### Getting the Script of Made in Abyss and One Piece Red

Using Sublikescript to get script anime movies such as One Piece Red Movie and Made in Abyss.

```{r anime script, include=FALSE}
url1 <-"https://subslikescript.com/movie/Made_in_Abyss-7222086"

url2 <-"https://subslikescript.com/movie/One_Piece_Film_Red-16183464"

```

### Extract Made in Abyss script, check for character,and split into sentece,

Read the Made in Abyss with the html node of the full script. The ".full-script" receive the full text of Made In Abyss script. After the receiving the text, checking the variable if character since the text is string character. Then split the text into sentence to read carefully and the code to read carefully.

```{r Made In Abyss Script, include=FALSE}
#Read HTML and extract text
xxx.Abyss <- url1 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(".full-script") %>%
  html_text()

#Check if xxx.Abyss is a character vector
if (!is.character(xxx.Abyss)) {
  xxx.Abyss <- as.character(xxx.Abyss)
}

#Split the text into sentence
xxx.abyss.split <- unlist(str_split(xxx.Abyss,"\\."))

```

### Extract One Piece Red script, check for character, and split into sentece

Read the One Piece Red with the html node of the full script. The ".full-script" receive the full text of One Piece Red script. After the receiving the text, checking the variable if character since the text is string character. Then split the text into sentence to read carefully and the code to read carefully.

```{r One Piece Red, include=FALSE}
#Read HTML and extract text
xxx.One <- url2 %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(".full-script") %>%
  html_text()

#Check if xxx.One is a character vector
if (!is.character(xxx.One)) {
  xxx.One <- as.character(xxx.One)
}

#Split the text into sentence
xxx.one.split <- unlist(str_split(xxx.One,"\\."))

```

### Cleaning the Made in Abyss with tm Corpus

Using tm is lot easier to clean the text and remove stop words. Replacing the unnecessary words as blanks such as "offthis" or "mitty"

```{r include=FALSE}
#Cleaning the text and getting the stop words
stopwords("en")
AbbysCorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(xxx.abyss.split))

AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, tolower)

AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, removePunctuation)

AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, removeNumbers)


AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, removeWords,stopwords("en"))
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, stripWhitespace)
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "youre", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "hey", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "whats", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "firstah", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "offthis", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "innards", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "nanachius", replacement = "us")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "wwel", replacement = " ")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "ityou", replacement = "you")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "restor", replacement = "restore")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "nanachi", replacement = "")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "mitty", replacement = "")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "reg", replacement = "")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "riko", replacement = "")
AbbysCorpus <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "adsbygoog", replacement = "")

```

### Cleaning the One Piece Red with tm Corpus

Same as Made in Abyss with using the library of tm to clean out junk, stop word, and unnecessary words

```{r include=FALSE}
#Cleaning the text and getting the stop words
OnePCorpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(xxx.one.split))
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, tolower)
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, removePunctuation)
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, removeNumbers)

stopwords("en")

OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, removeWords,stopwords("en"))
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, stripWhitespace)
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "im", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "dont", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "uta", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "planluffi", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "erapleas", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "kirbyguy", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "fingersluffyyou", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = "cao", replacement = " ")
OnePCorpus <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, content_transformer(gsub), pattern = " youunfortun", replacement = " ")

```

#Frequency number of Made in Abyss and One Piece The graph for the frequent words that appear in Made in Abyss and One Piece Red in separate graph.

```{r}
madein_abyss <- tm_map(AbbysCorpus, stemDocument)

term_countabby <- freq_terms(madein_abyss,20)

plot(term_countabby)


one_piece_r <- tm_map(OnePCorpus, stemDocument)
term_countonep <- freq_terms(one_piece_r,20)

plot(term_countonep)

```

### Creating Document Term Matrix,Sort the Frequency, and plot the most frequent words for Made in Abyss

The Document-Term Matrix that show the relationship which each row as document and the columns as the terms.The top 5 most frequent word is "just" with the count number of 30.

```{r echo=TRUE}
#To Analyze the text data, using the Document-Term Matrix (DTM)
Abby_Made = DocumentTermMatrix(madein_abyss)
inspect(Abby_Made)
miabyss_m <- as.matrix(Abby_Made)

#Sort by decreasing value of frequency
miabyss_v <- sort(colSums(miabyss_m),decreasing = TRUE)
miabyss_d <- data.frame(word = names(miabyss_v), freq=miabyss_v)
head(miabyss_d, 5)

#Plot the most frequent words
barplot(miabyss_d[1:5,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = miabyss_d[1:5,]$word,
        col = "lightgreen",main = "Top 5 most frequent words",
        ylab = "Word frequencis")

```

###Creating Document Term Matrix,Sort the Frequency, and plot the most frequent words for One Piece Red The Document-Term Matrix that show the relationship which each row as document and the columns as the terms.The top 5 most frequent word is "let" with the count number of 40.

```{r}
#Building Document-Term Matrix (DTM)
One_Red = DocumentTermMatrix(one_piece_r)
inspect(One_Red)
onepiecer_m <- as.matrix(One_Red)

#Sort by decreasing value of frequency
onepiecer_v <- sort(colSums(onepiecer_m),decreasing = TRUE)
onepiecer_d <- data.frame(word = names(onepiecer_v), freq=onepiecer_v)
head(onepiecer_d, 5)

#Plot the most frequent words
barplot(onepiecer_d[1:5,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = onepiecer_d[1:5,]$word,
        col = "red",main = "Top 5 most frequent words",
        ylab = "Word frequencis")

```

### World Cloud for Made in Abyss and word assocation

```{r fig.width= 9, fig.height=6}
#Generate Word Cloud
set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = miabyss_d$word, freq = miabyss_d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))

#Word Association 
findAssocs(Abby_Made, terms = c("just","like","pleas"), corlimit = 0.25)
```

### World Cloud for One Piece Redand word assocation

```{r fig.width= 9, fig.height=6}
#Generate Word Cloud
set.seed(1234)
wordcloud(words = onepiecer_d$word, freq = onepiecer_d$freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))

#Word Association 
findAssocs(One_Red, terms = c("want","sea","new"), corlimit = 0.25)
```

### Positive/Negative and Emotion of Made in Abyss

Made in Abyss has lot of negative words and lot of fear since the movie has its scary moments and show words that relates the character's fear.

```{r}
# Calculate sentiment scores of Made in Abyss
result <- get_nrc_sentiment(as.character(madein_abyss))
result1<-data.frame(t(result))
Made_in_Abyss <- data.frame(rowSums(result1))

#name rows and columns of the data frame
names(Made_in_Abyss)[1] <- "count"
Made_in_Abyss <- cbind("sentiment" = rownames(Made_in_Abyss), Made_in_Abyss)
rownames(Made_in_Abyss) <- NULL

#plot the first 8 rows,the distinct emotions
qplot(sentiment, data=Made_in_Abyss[1:8,], weight=count, geom="bar",fill=sentiment)+ggtitle("Made in Abyss Sentiments")

#plot the last 2 rows ,positive and negative
qplot(sentiment, data=Made_in_Abyss[9:10,], weight=count, geom="bar",fill=sentiment)+ggtitle("Made in Abyss Sentiments")

```

### Positive/Negative and Emotion of One Piece Red

This is similar to Made in Abyss of fear and negative. This may result of characters being scare or showing fear through other characters.

```{r}
# Calculate sentiment scores of Made in Abyss
result2 <- get_nrc_sentiment(as.character(one_piece_r))
result21<-data.frame(t(result2))
One_Piece_Red <- data.frame(rowSums(result21))

#name rows and columns of the data frame
names(One_Piece_Red)[1] <- "count"
One_Piece_Red <- cbind("sentiment" = rownames(One_Piece_Red), One_Piece_Red)
rownames(One_Piece_Red) <- NULL

#plot the first 8 rows,the distinct emotions
qplot(sentiment, data=One_Piece_Red[1:8,], weight=count, geom="bar",fill=sentiment)+ggtitle("One Piece Red Sentiments")

#plot the last 2 rows ,positive and negative
qplot(sentiment, data=One_Piece_Red[9:10,], weight=count, geom="bar",fill=sentiment)+ggtitle("One Piece Red Sentiments")


```

In conclusion, both anime movies show words that is more negative but still have words that is positive that the character made state in the script. The emotion in characters in Made in Abyss and One Piece Red show a lot fear which indicate the negative words and character said something scary to scare the character.
